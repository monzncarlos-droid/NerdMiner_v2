# NerdSoloMiner

**The NerdSoloMiner v2**

This is a **free and open source project** that let you try to reach a bitcoin block with a small piece of hardware.

The main aim of this project is to let you **learn more about minery** and to have a beautiful piece of hardware in your desktop.

## Web Dashboard (NerdMiner v3)

NerdMiner v3 adds a **built-in web dashboard** served directly from the device — no app, no cloud, no extra hardware required.

![Web Dashboard](images/dashboard_preview.png)

### Features

- **Live stats** — hashrate, shares accepted/rejected, best difficulty, uptime, free heap, on-die temperature (S3), templates received, plus a live **System Health** score and activity feed
- **Fleet view** — monitor *all* your miners from one dashboard: **Scan LAN** auto-discovers every NerdMiner on your subnet via mDNS (or add them by IP/hostname), then see combined hashrate, total shares, per-device status, and firmware version side by side. **Restart all** applies one action to the entire fleet. Firmware is updated per-miner from its own dashboard — see [OTA](#fleet-view)
- **Real-time share log & alerts** — accepted/rejected shares and pool disconnects appear live as they happen
- **Hashrate history chart** — selectable **1H / 6H / 24H / 7D / 30D** ranges backed by an on-device ring buffer (`/api/history`), with current / average / max / min / variance readouts
- **One-click pool switching** — pick a pool from the toolbar dropdown to retarget the miner instantly (list is served from the firmware's pool registry)
- **Pool & WiFi status** — connection state, IP address, signal strength
- **Config panel** — update wallet address, pool URL/port, and timezone directly from the browser
- **OTA firmware update** — drag-and-drop `.bin` upload with progress bar; no USB cable needed
- **Restart / Factory Reset** — one-click buttons with confirmation dialogs
- **Optional API token auth** — protect the API behind a bearer token (set `WEBUI_AUTH_TOKEN` in build flags). The dashboard prompts for the token on first use and remembers it per-browser (Settings → API token); one token works across the whole fleet, including fleet-wide restart and OTA
- **WireGuard VPN** *(opt-in build)* — a full-tunnel WireGuard client so a miner behind NAT is reachable at its tunnel IP and its pool traffic is encrypted end-to-end. Supports preshared keys, reports the real handshake state, and falls back to direct routing if the tunnel never comes up. Configure the tunnel IP, server endpoint, and keys in Settings; a VPN badge shows tunnel state. See [WireGuard VPN](#wireguard-vpn) below
- **Webhook alerts** — the miner posts to a **Discord**, **ntfy**, or generic JSON webhook when it finds a block, its pool or VPN drops, or it comes online. Configure it in Settings with a **Send test** button; works with no browser open (the device sends directly)
- **Themes** — switch the dashboard skin in Settings: **Aurora** (the default cyan/violet), **Classic** (dark + gold), **Cyber Matrix** (phosphor-green terminal), **Synthwave**, or **Nord**. Applies instantly and is remembered per-browser
- **Mobile-friendly** — responsive dark UI, works on any browser

The **Fleet** view aggregates every miner on your network in one place — add them manually or hit **Scan LAN** to auto-discover them:

### Accessing the Dashboard

1. Flash the firmware and connect the device to your WiFi via the `NerdMinerAP` captive portal
2. Find the device IP on your router, or check the serial output
3. Open `http://<device-ip>/` in any browser

### REST API

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/status` | Live mining stats (JSON) |
| `GET` | `/api/system` | Chip info, free heap, uptime |
| `GET` | `/api/config` | Current saved config |
| `POST` | `/api/config` | Update config (restarts device) |
| `GET` | `/api/pools` | Known-pool registry used by the pool switcher |
| `GET` | `/api/pool/test` | Test reachability of the current pool |
| `POST` | `/api/alert/test` | Fire a test webhook (optional `{url,service}` to test before saving) |
| `POST` | `/api/restart` | Soft restart |
| `POST` | `/api/reset` | Factory reset (clears NVS) |
| `POST` | `/api/ota` | OTA firmware upload (multipart) |
| `GET` | `/api/fleet` | Fleet host list stored on this device |
| `POST` | `/api/fleet` | Merge a `{"add":[],"remove":[]}` delta into the fleet list |
| `GET` | `/api/discover` | mDNS discovery of other NerdMiners on the LAN |

> **Fleet polling:** the Fleet view fetches each miner's `/api/status` directly from your browser (CORS is enabled), so all miners must be on the same network you're browsing from. The miner list is persisted on the device itself (`/api/fleet`), so every browser that opens a miner's dashboard sees the same fleet; `localStorage` is only used as a local cache for instant paint.

> **OTA partition requirement:** `/api/ota` needs a partition table with two app slots. **All six web-UI environments now have them**, so every dashboard-capable board is OTA-updatable:
>
> | Environment | Flash | Partition table | App slot |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | `ESP32-devKitv1` | 4 MB | `partitions/nerdminer_ota_4MB.csv` | 1984 KB |
> | `NerdminerV2` | 8 MB | `default_8MB.csv` | 3264 KB |
> | `ESP32-S3-devKitv1` | 8 MB | `default_8MB.csv` | 3264 KB |
> | `esp32-s3-devkitc1-n32r8` | 8 MB | `default_8MB.csv` | 3264 KB |
> | `NerdminerV2-S3-AMOLED` | 16 MB | `default_16MB.csv` | 6400 KB |
> | `NerdminerV2-T-HMI` | 16 MB | `default_16MB.csv` | 6400 KB |
>
> **Update one miner at a time**, from its own dashboard: **Settings → Firmware update (OTA)**. There is deliberately no fleet-wide "update all" button. One `.bin` only ever fits one board, and `ESP.getChipModel()` cannot tell an S3 DevKit from an S3 AMOLED — both report `ESP32-S3` — so a wrong-board image would flash cleanly, pass verification, and then boot into the wrong display and pin drivers. `/api/status` reports the PlatformIO environment name as `"board"`, and the OTA dialog names the board the image must be built for.
>
> **Upload the bare app image** — `bin/prebuilt/<env>/firmware.bin` (or `.pio/build/<env>/firmware.bin`), *not* the merged `*_factory.bin`. A factory image contains the bootloader and partition table and would be written into the app slot; the dashboard rejects the filename and the device refuses it outright (it sniffs for a partition-table header at offset `0x8000`).
>
> A board on a single-slot table such as `huge_app.csv` is detected at runtime and **refuses** the update rather than erasing the running firmware: `/api/status` reports `"ota": false` and the dashboard hides the option.
>
> Switching a board from `huge_app.csv` relocates SPIFFS, so the **first** flash with the new table must go over USB. `nvs` sits at `0x9000` in every table, so **WiFi credentials survive**. Everything in SPIFFS does not: `config.json` (pool, wallet, pool password, alert webhook, WireGuard, timezone, brightness, and the *save stats to NVS* toggle) and the separate `fleet.json` host list are both erased, so re-enter those settings and re-add your miners in the Fleet view. OTA works from then on.

### WireGuard VPN

A miner can join a [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) VPN as a full-tunnel client. Two things this buys you:

- **Remote access** — reach the dashboard/API at the miner's tunnel IP from anywhere, with no port-forwarding on your home router (the miner dials *out* to your WireGuard server).
- **Encrypted pool traffic** — the miner's default route moves into the tunnel, so the stratum connection leaves your network through the VPN. LAN traffic (the dashboard, fleet polling to other miners on the same subnet) stays direct, so remote *and* local access both keep working.

**Enable it at build time** (it's opt-in so boards that don't need it don't pay the ~31 KB of crypto). The easiest way is `flash.sh` / `flash.bat`: pick a dashboard-capable board and answer **"Enable WireGuard VPN?"** — the script injects `-D ENABLE_WIREGUARD=1` for that build only. It's offered for the web-UI envs (`NerdminerV2`, `ESP32-S3-devKitv1`, `esp32-s3-devkitc1-n32r8`, `ESP32-devKitv1`, `NerdminerV2-S3-AMOLED`, `NerdminerV2-T-HMI`), which already carry the `felipedadison/WireGuard-ESP32` lib. To build it directly instead, add `-D ENABLE_WIREGUARD=1` to that env's `build_flags` (or run `PLATFORMIO_BUILD_FLAGS="-DENABLE_WIREGUARD=1" pio run -e <env>`). For any other board, also add the lib to its `lib_deps`.

**Configure it** in the dashboard under **Settings → WireGuard VPN**:

| Field | Example | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Tunnel IP (this device) | `10.6.0.2` | the address your WG server assigns this peer |
| Server endpoint | `vpn.example.com` | host or IP of your WG server (resolved via DNS) |
| Endpoint port | `51820` | |
| Server public key | `base64…` | your WG server's public key (`PublicKey` under `[Peer]`) |
| This device's private key | `base64…` | stored on the miner; **never** returned by the API — leave blank when editing to keep the current one |
| Preshared key | `base64…` | optional, 44 chars. **Required if your server's peer config has a `PresharedKey` line** — omit it and the handshake fails silently |

The simplest route is to have your server generate a peer config and copy each line across: `Address` → tunnel IP (drop the `/32`), `PrivateKey` → private key, `PublicKey` → server public key, `PresharedKey` → preshared key, and `Endpoint` → server endpoint + port. Take the port from that config rather than assuming `51820` — servers that create one WireGuard instance per device (FRITZ!Box, for example) hand out a different port each time. Otherwise generate a keypair yourself with `wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey`, put the **private** key on the miner and add the miner's **public** key (with `AllowedIPs = 10.6.0.2/32`) as a `[Peer]` on your server.

Saving restarts the miner. The **VPN** badge in the header turns green only after a real handshake completes; `/api/status` reports `wg_state` as `off`, `connecting`, `up`, or `failed`. If no handshake lands within 20 s the miner tears the tunnel down, restores direct routing, and retries three times before giving up — so a wrong key or port leaves you with a reachable miner and no VPN, never a miner that has vanished off the network. The serial log names the likely cause. The tunnel needs the clock set, which the miner does from NTP before bringing WireGuard up.

> **Preshared keys:** many server front-ends (FRITZ!Box, wg-easy, PiVPN) add a `PresharedKey` to every peer they generate. The upstream `WireGuard-ESP32` Arduino wrapper hard-codes `preshared_key = NULL` and can never handshake with such a server, so this firmware drives the underlying `wireguardif` layer directly instead. If your server has no `PresharedKey`, leave the field empty; tick **Remove the stored preshared key** to clear one that was set by mistake.

> **Security:** the private and preshared keys live in the miner's `config.json` (SPIFFS) and are used only for the tunnel — both are write-only over the API (never sent back to a browser; `/api/config` returns only `wg_has_privkey` / `wg_has_psk`) and are never printed to the serial console. Two limitations to understand:
> - **Build with `WEBUI_AUTH_TOKEN`.** Without a token, `checkAuth()` allows everyone, so any device on your LAN can `POST /api/config` a new endpoint + private key and, after the automatic restart, redirect the miner's full tunnel through *their* server. On a VPN build the token is not optional.
> - **No TLS.** The ESP32 serves plain HTTP, so the private key travels the LAN in cleartext when you first paste it into Settings. Provision over a trusted network segment.
>
> **Downgrading:** once a tunnel is configured, `config.json` grows by the two keys + endpoint. Firmware from *before* this feature reads config with a smaller JSON buffer and may fail to parse the larger file, dropping into WiFi provisioning. If you roll back, expect to re-enter wallet/pool settings once.

### Flash Scripts

Use the included scripts to build and flash from source in one step:

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x flash.sh && ./flash.sh
```

**Windows:**
```
flash.bat
```

Both scripts auto-detect your serial port and let you choose your board from a menu, then offer two methods:

1. **Build from source** — needs [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/); always current, and the only way to enable the [WireGuard VPN](#wireguard-vpn) opt-in.
2. **Flash pre-built `.bin` files** — needs only `esptool`, no toolchain. Pre-built images ship for **every board in the menu** under `bin/prebuilt/<env>/`.

The web-dashboard boards' pre-built images include the dashboard. If you flash a pre-built image and the miner runs but `http://<device-ip>/` never loads, you're likely on an outdated checkout — `git pull` and re-flash, or build from source.

> **Maintainers:** after any firmware change, refresh the pre-built bins with `./bin/regenerate_prebuilt.sh` (rebuilds every board, copies the four bins per env, and fails if a dashboard board's image is missing the web UI). Regenerate a single board with `./bin/regenerate_prebuilt.sh <env>`.

> **Already configured a device?** A firmware flash keeps saved Wi-Fi, so the `NerdMinerAP` portal won't reappear. To reconfigure from scratch, erase first: `pio run -e <env> --target erase --upload-port <port>` (or `esptool --port <port> erase_flash`), then flash.

## Requirements

- TTGO T-Display S3 or any supported boards (check Build tutorial 👇)
- 3D BOX [here](3d_files/)

### Project description

**ESP32 implementing Stratum protocol** to mine on solo pool. Pool can be changed but originally works with [public-pool.io](https://web.public-pool.io) (where Nerdminers are supported).

This project was initialy developed using ESP32-S3, but currently support other boards. It uses WifiManager to modify miner settings and save them to SPIFF.
The microMiner comes with several screens to monitor it's working procedure and also to show you network mining stats.
Currently includes:

- NerdMiner Screen > Mining data of Nerdminer
- ClockMiner Screen > Fashion style clock miner
- GlobalStats Screen > Global minery stats and relevant data

This miner is multicore and multithreads, both cores are used to mine and several threads are used to implementing stratum work and wifi stuff.
Every time an stratum job notification is received miner update its current work to not create stale shares.

**IMPORTANT** Miner is not seen by all standard pools due to its low share difficulty. You can check miner work remotely using specific pools specified down or seeing logs via UART.

**_Current project is still in developement and more features will be added_**

### Flash firmware

#### microMiners Flashtool [Recommended]

Easyiest way to flash firmware. Build your own miner using the folowing firwmare flash tool:

1. Get a TTGO T-display S3 or any other supported board
1. Go to NM2 flasher online: https://flasher.bitronics.store/ (recommend via Google Chrome incognito mode)

#### Standard tool

Create your own miner using the online firwmare flash tool **ESPtool** and one of the **binary files** that you will find in the `bin` folder.
If you want you can compile the entire project using Arduino, PlatformIO or Expressif IDF.

1. Get a TTGO T-display S3 or any supported board
1. Download this repository
1. Go to ESPtool online: https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/
1. Load the firmware with the binary from one of the sub-folders of `bin` corresponding to your board.
1. Plug your board and select each file from the sub-folder (`.bin` files).

### Update firmware

Update NerdMiner firmware following same flashing steps but only using the file 0x10000_firmware.bin.

#### Build troubleshooting

1. Online [ESP Tool](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/) works with chrome, chromium, brave
1. ESPtool recommendations: use 115200bps
1. Build errors > If during firmware download upload stops, it's recommended to enter the board in boot mode. Unplug cable, hold right bottom button and then plug cable. Try programming
1. In extreme case you can "Erase all flash" on ESPtool to clean all current configuration before uploading firmware. There has been cases that experimented Wifi failures until this was made.
1. In case of ESP32-WROOM Boards, could be necessary to put your board on boot mode. Hold boot button, press reset button and then program.

## NerdMiner configuration

After programming, you will only need to setup your Wifi and BTC address.

Note: when BTC address of your selected wallet is not provided, mining will not be started.

#### Wifi Accesspoint


1. Connect to NerdMinerAP
   - AP: NerdMinerAP
   - PASS: MineYourCoins
1. Set up your Wifi Network
1. Add your BTC address
1. Change the password if needed

   - If you are using public-pool.io and you want to set a custom name to your worker you can append a string with format _.yourworkername_ to the address


#### SD card (if available)

1. Format a SD card using Fat32.
1. Create a file named "config.json" in your card's root, containing the the following structure. Adjust the settings to your needs:  
```
{  
  "SSID": "myWifiSSID",  
  "WifiPW": "myWifiPassword",  
  "PoolUrl": "public-pool.io",  
  "PoolPort": 21496,
  "PoolPassword": "x",
  "BtcWallet": "walletID",  
  "Timezone": 2,  
  "SaveStats": false  
}
```

1. Insert the SD card.
1. Hold down the "reset configurations" button as described below to reset the configurations and/or boot without settings in your nvmemory.
1. Power down to remove the SD card. It is not needed for mining.

## Developers

### Project guidelines

- Current project was adapted to work with PlatformIO
- Current project works with ESP32-S3 and ESP32-wroom.
- Partition scheme: boards with the web dashboard use a **two-app-slot** table (`partitions/nerdminer_ota_4MB.csv`, `default_8MB.csv` or `default_16MB.csv`) so `/api/ota` works — see [the OTA partition requirement](#fleet-view). Only display-only boards without the dashboard may use the single-slot `huge_app.csv`
- All libraries needed shown on platform.ini

### Job done

- [x] Move project to platformIO
- [x] Bug rectangle on screen when 1milion shares
